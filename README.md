A minimal command runner.

## ðŸ¤” Comparison

This tool is heavily inspired by [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just/), but is fundamentally different. To summarize:

- Pro: It handles arguments correctly, and without any ambiguity
    - `just` could cause argument splitting issues
    - Although [there are workarounds](https://just.systems/man/en/avoiding-argument-splitting.html), corner cases still exist
- Pro: Is independent of shell
- Con: But at the cost of much less customization and features

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

### Using [`binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall)

```shell
cargo binstall jiu
```

### Downloading from Releases

Navigate to the [Releases page](https://github.com/PRO-2684/jiu/releases) and download respective binary for your platform. Make sure to give it execute permissions.

### Compiling from Source

```shell
cargo install jiu
```

</details>

See [`.jiu.toml`](./.jiu.toml) for a simple example used in this repository, ~~or the [`tests`](./tests) directory for more complex examples~~. Here's an example involving complex arguments:

```shell
jiu dummy 1 "2" '"3"' " 4" "" "5 6"
```

Which will invoke [`dummy.sh`](./scripts/dummy.sh), printing arguments it received:

```shell
Arg#1: 1
The rest:
2
"3"
 4

5 6
```

Note that the arguments are all handled correctly.

## ðŸ“– Usage

### Configuration

The config file is a simple TOML file named `.jiu.toml`. The format is as follows:

```toml
description = "`jiu`: A minimal command runner." # Description of the configuration (Optional)
# - Will be displayed when listing recipes
# - To add some colors to the dull description, use ANSI escape codes like:
#   description = "\u001b[1;36mjiu\u001b[22;39m: A minimal command runner."
default = "run" # Default recipe to run when invoked without any arguments (Optional)
# - List all recipes if empty
# - Default recipe must be able to accept no arguments

[[recipes]]
names = ["run", "r"] # Names of the recipe (Required, must contain at least one name and each name should be unique across all recipes)
description = "Compile and run" # Description of the recipe (Optional)
arguments = ["*rest"] # Arguments to the recipe (Optional)
command = ["cargo", "run", "--", ["*rest"]] # Command to run (Required)

# ...More recipes
```

#### Arguments

The `arguments` field is a list of arguments that the recipe accepts. It should be a list of strings, where each string represents an argument. An argument is made up of an optional leading symbol and a name. The leading symbol can be one of the following:

- `*`: A variadic argument. This means that the argument can accept zero or more values.
- `+`: A required variadic argument. This means that the argument must accept one or more values.
- `?`: An optional argument. This means that the argument can accept zero or one value.

If the leading symbol is omitted, the argument is treated as a required argument.

#### Command

The `command` field is a list made up of strings and arrays that represents the command to run. Each string is treated as a literal string, while each array is treated as a placeholder for the arguments. The placeholders are replaced with the values of the arguments when the command is run. After the arguments are resolved, the command is executed in the directory of the config file.

#### Greedy Matching

> [!NOTE]
> This behavior may be changed in the future, but for now, it is a known limitation.

The `*` and `+` arguments are greedy, meaning that they will consume all remaining arguments. For example, if you have a recipe with the following arguments:

```toml
arguments = ["*arg0", "*arg1"]
```

Then `*arg1` will always be empty, since `*arg0` will consume all remaining arguments. Also consider:

```toml
arguments = ["*arg0", "arg1"]
```

In this case, `*arg0` will consume all remaining arguments, leaving required argument `arg1` empty. So `jiu` will return an error, although the arguments can be interpreted without ambiguity.

Also be careful when working with optional arguments, since they share the same greedy behavior. For example:

```toml
arguments = ["?arg0", "arg1"]
```

When a single argument is passed, `?arg0` will consume it, leaving `arg1` empty. So this will also cause an error.

### Running

To run a recipe, simply call `jiu` with the name of the recipe and arguments for the recipe:

```shell
jiu <recipe> [<args>...]
```

### Debugging

Run with environment variable `JIU_DEBUG` set to enable debug mode. In bash, you can do this with:

```shell
JIU_DEBUG=1 jiu <recipe> [<args>...]
```

Which would provide additional information for debugging purposes.

## âœ… TODO

- `env` field on recipes and global
- Interpreting environment variables in commands (`["$VAR"]`)
- Set working directories
    - Where the config file is located (default)
    - Where the command is invoked
    - Custom working directory, relative to the config file
