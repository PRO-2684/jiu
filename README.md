## ðŸ¤” Comparison

This tool is heavily inspired by [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just/), but is fundamentally different. To summarize:

- Pro: It handles arguments correctly, and without any ambiguity
    - `just` could cause argument splitting issues
    - Although [there are workarounds](https://just.systems/man/en/avoiding-argument-splitting.html), corner cases still exist
- Pro: Is independent of shell
- Con: But at the cost of much less customization and features
